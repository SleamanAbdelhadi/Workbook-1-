# shopping-list-x
This little program shows a lot of the features of a Java Project for IntelliJ/Maven

1. Java source files are all grouped under the src/main/java directory

2. Classes are defined in the package org.yearup.shopping

3. The class named Main holds the main() method

4. Fruit and Receipt are simplified record classes

5. Size is an enumerated type (an enum class)

6. An array of Fruit is used together with a for-each loop
